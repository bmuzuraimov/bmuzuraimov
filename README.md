# Hi there, I'm IT Father ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer with experience in Python, Java, and C++. I also have a background in data science, machine learning, and product development. I'm passionate about creating software that solves real-world problems and makes people's lives easier.

## Skills
Here are some of the skills I've developed over the years:

* Python, Java, C++ (Advanced): I'm proficient in these programming languages and have used them to build a variety of applications, from web apps to machine learning models.

* Data Science (Pandas), Machine Learning (sklearn): I have experience using Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, and have used sklearn to build predictive models.

* Data Mining (Selenium, Beautiful Soup): I've used these tools to extract data from websites and APIs for various projects.

* Product Development (Laravel, MERN): I have experience building web applications using Laravel and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).

* Azure, AWS, GCP: I've worked with these cloud platforms to deploy and manage applications in the cloud.

## Projects

[Nodeon](https://nodeon.me) is a Notion integration that automates scheduling and task management for students. The system analyzes a student's behavior and task requirements realistically, rescheduling and calculating the amount of time required for tasks. The software features a chatbot that uses natural language processing to understand and respond to user commands from their Notion dashboard. The system is designed for scalability and is monetized through a premium subscription model that offers extra features.

[eHospital-PHP-MySQL](https://github.com/bmuzuraimov/eHospital-application-PHP-MySQL): The eHospital application is a web-based hospital management system developed using PHP and MySQL with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The application simplifies hospital management tasks and makes it easier for doctors, nurses, and hospital administrators to manage patient data, appointments, and other hospital-related tasks. The application includes features such as user authentication and authorization, chat functionality, medicine and pharmacy management, diagnostic and treatment tools, **patients classification using KNN algorithm**.

[IoT-Connector](https://github.com/bmuzuraimov/IoT-Connector): IoT-Connector is a PHP framework that enables two-way communication with IoT devices.

[Forum Scraper and MongoDB Cloud Storage](https://github.com/bmuzuraimov/Forum-Scraper-and-MongoDB-Cloud-Storage): Python-based web scraper that retrieves data from website forums and stores it in MongoDB cloud.
